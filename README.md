# Computer Vision for Newbies
I'll create something amazing in here. Hopefully I can review some computer vision technique and share it to you. Feel free to learn and ask me!

## Why I created this repository?
Recently, I missed playing with computer vision and I think while I exploring computer vision techniques I also want to share everything I know in this topics. I know everyone is hyping for Generative AI, but I think if you understand about some basic computer vision it will be easier to dive inside Gen-AI. So don't forget about the basics!

# The content is coming soon, so just wait for the fun!
