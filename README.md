# Computer Vision for Newbies
I'll create something amazing in here. Hopefully I can review some computer vision technique and share it to you. Feel free to learn and ask me!

## Why I created this repository?
Recently, I missed playing with computer vision and I think while I exploring computer vision techniques I also want to share everything I know in this topics. I know everyone is hyping for Generative AI, but I think if you understand about some basic computer vision it will be easier to dive inside Gen-AI. So don't forget about the basics!

## What will I cover in this repository?
This is only my plan, it can be changed if I find something insightful.
1. What is Images? What's inside it?
2. Basic Math for CV
3. Basic Image Manipulation
   - Grayscale
   - Resize
   - Brightness
   - Contrast
4. Convolution
5. Segmentation
6. Image Classification
7. CNN
